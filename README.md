# GO_DQN
Combining DQN Variants with Go_Explore


This repository is designed for me to experiment with combining DQN algorithms with the GO_Explore 'First Return, Then Explore' algorithm.

There is more information on the algorithms and their results in each folder.

With thanks to: 
* ryanrudes and his brilliant implementation of [Minimal Go_Explore](https://github.com/ryanrudes/minimal_goexplore)
* I did take inspiration for the DQN variants, however, I am unable to locate the creator. I will add it when I find it or if you recognise any of your code please contact me and I shall credit you.
